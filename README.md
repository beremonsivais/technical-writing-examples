# Technical writing examples
Have a look around my technical writing portfolio. Neatly organized folders will take you to different types of writing. Enjoy!

## Contributions to open source projects
Working with multidisciplinary teams is fundamental in technical writing. My computer science background helps me to understand the SME (subject matter expert) in the team. This allows me to navigate technical documentation which I can then transform into different styles of writing depending on the end user.

## Manuals
It's all about the user finding the manual easy to use. This may mean changing the information contained
in the manual to target different end users. In the BEFORE an AFTER files you will see the shift in understanding the reader.
