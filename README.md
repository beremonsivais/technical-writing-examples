# Technical writing examples
Have a look around my technical writing portfolio. Neatly organized folders will take you to different types of writing. Enjoy!

## [Open source projects](/open-source-projects)
Working with multidisciplinary teams is fundamental in technical writing. My computer science background enables me to understand the SME (subject matter expert) on the team. It also allows me to navigate technical documentation which I can then transform into different styles of writing depending on the end user.

## [Manuals](/manuals)
It's all about the user finding the manual simple to follow. This may mean changing the information contained
in the manual depending on the end user. In the BEFORE an AFTER files you will see the shift in better understanding the reader.
